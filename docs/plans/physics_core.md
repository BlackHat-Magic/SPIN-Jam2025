# Physics Core Plan

## TDD Log
- **[Red | 2025-09-24]** Draft physics design doc is missing. `docs/requirements.md` expects a document covering target features, ECS integration, and math utilities, but no such outline exists yet.

## Design Outline (Pending)
- **Rigid Bodies & Forces:** _pending drafting_
- **Collider Shapes:** _pending drafting_
- **Collision Detection:** _pending drafting_
- **Constraint Solver:** _pending drafting_
- **ECS Integration:** _pending drafting_
- **Math Utilities:** _pending drafting_

## Open Questions
- How should the physics world resource be structured to cooperate with existing `SystemStage` ordering?
- Which initial shapes should be prioritized for prototype coverage?
